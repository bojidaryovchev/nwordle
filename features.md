## Game Mode

- easy mode - no restrictions
- hard mode - any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses
- super-hard mode - any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses and the letters revealed to be absent are forbidden

## Timer

- the user has the ability to time themselves solving the wordle
- the time is tracked from when they press start until they win or lose
- timer gets reset when the wordle gets reset
- include time-based ranking as a section of the scoreboard
- maybe use timer records for analytics (track the user timetables in terms of advertisement)

## Win Streak

- keep track of the user's wins and losses
- keep track of consecutive wins
- keep track of maximum consecutive wins (personal record)
- keep track of win rate percentage

## Ranking

- the ranking is segregated by game mode
- there is a separate ranking for **n=2**, **n=3**, ..., **n=15**
- the user has the ability to see their rank based on their choosing of game mode and their performance

## Scoreboard

- top 10, top 50, top 100, top 500
- different scoreboard for each **n** value
- how do we measure performance?
  -- number of attempts
  -- time
  -- number of attempts + time

## Personal Records

- games played
- win rate percentage
- longest win streak
- rankings-to-date graph
- to be contnued
